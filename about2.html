        <p class="container">
          The problem we are dealing with is how current cup holders found in 
          cars do not fit all sizes of cups and overall are not secure enough 
          the way they are. To solve this problem of cup holders not catering 
          to all users, we decided to make a cup holder that will accomplish 
          this. Our solution is an automated universal cup holder as its main 
          function is to close upon any type of bottle, regardless of size, as 
          well as hold the object tight. The reason why our design is superior 
          to that of prior solutions is because of its flexibility and 
          secureness. Most of the prior solutions, such as the Dorman Cup 
          Holder and the Smart Kup Car Cup Holder, have fixed sizes in which 
          only certain sized bottles are able to fit within them. Even the 
          Delta Cycle Expanding Beverage Holder had limits in terms of how much
          it could hold. This product was also only usable for bikes. We improve
          on all of these designs through our product flexibility as well as 
          its overall performance. Our design is simply a display of how our 
          solution will operate. It proposes a system of rails, bump switches 
          and a SONAR sensor in which the SONAR will sense whether an object 
          is present, which will trigger the rails to push the bump switches 
          together. The bump switches, once pressed, will immediately stop 
          and at that point, the bottle will be secure. To release this, a 
          limit switch will be pressed in order to pull back the bump switches
          and the bottle will then be easily retrieved by the user. For our 
          actual final design, we intend it to be directly installed within 
          cars and utilize malleable metals such as aluminum or steel alloy 
          shines for a sleeker appearance. Future improvements and implications
          would consist of making it so that the system recognizes tension so 
          that it would release automatically the moment a user grabs the bottle.
